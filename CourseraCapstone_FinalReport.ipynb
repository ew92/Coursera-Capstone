    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a particular market segment of bar patrons, inner Sydney has seen an emerging preference for small bars. While traditional Australian licensed venue types remain popular – pubs/hotels/bistros, sports and RSL clubs, nightclubs – the small bar is an emerging venue of choice for people looking for an intimate, ambient setting that is either quieter or meets an aesthetically distinct niche, compared to the larger licensed venues. The New South Wales government defines a small bar licence as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "'A small bar licence allows you to sell alcohol for consumption on the licensed premises, but does not allow gaming or take-away liquor. This liquor licence allows a maximum of 120 customers, over the age of 18, on the premises during authorised trading hours.' \n",
    "(https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/transaction/apply-small-bar-licence#:~:text=A%20small%20bar%20licence%20allows,premises%20during%20authorised%20trading%20hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "The business opportunity arises particularly from the potential for conversion of unusual commercial properties into small bars. While many retailer types lose their physical presence in favour of online marketplaces, 'experience-based' venues – like small bars – remain a viable business option for the narrow lots in the commercial centres of inner Sydney suburbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more of a sense of what the specific offer is as distinct from other venue types, check out this page from the review site 'smallbarfly' recommending Sydney's best current small bars: http://www.smallbarfly.com/sydneys-best-small-bars/ – some of the keywords they use for their recommendation categories are 'quirky', 'hidden', 'romantic' and 'craft beer'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Small bars are a rising hospitality trend in Sydney's urban fringe outside the CBD, particularly in the inner west suburbs and in the areas just south of the CBD. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are opportunities for new small bar businesses in these suburbs but the selection of a potential location – with choices now opened up by options provided by smaller commercial lots of unusual types and special small bar licensing – is overwhelming. The report provides recommendations for the selection of small bar locations in Sydney's inner suburbs on the precipice of the CBD based on analysis of data from the Foursquare API and the Data.NSW open data portal.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Refining the suburbs of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "Per the data section above, the initial set of suburbs of interest were gathered from: the ABS via the greenash blog, Wikipedia and the Australia Post postcode lookup service. This returned 45 suburb names. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive mapping was not only used for visualisation of the analysis in this project - it also served a role in the exploratory stages to inspect the 45 geocoded suburbs. A number of exclusions were made from this initial list of suburbs and the mapping assisted these decisions and provided context for which suburbs were being removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the suburb points on the map revealed a number of suburbs to exclude from analysis. Firstly, Centennial Park and Moore Park because they are dominantly made up of parkland. Secondly, 'Sydney South' returned an incorrect set of coordinates. This makes sense as it is not a suburb – rather it is a postal distribution-related name which Nominatim attempted to geocode, but it is ultimately not a meaningful area to investigate. Third, 'Broadway' was mapped far away in the state's southwest. The area that this name should refer to was determined to be covered anyway by Chippendale and Glebe. Similarly, 'Beaconsfield' returned unintended coordinates off in a separate state (Victoria). Like Broadway, it is an area that is sufficiently covered by larger neighbouring suburbs (in that case, Alexandria and Zetland). So this was included for removal as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the main reason for the exploratory visualisation was to heuristically determine exclusion of the suburbs that make up the high density commercial CBD, which is not the geographic area of interest for the project (but was the necessary place to begin and move outward). The 'slice' of CBD suburbs removed from analysis curves around from the Pyrmont area, down to Central Station and then straight up along the latitude of Hyde Park, such that the following suburbs were excluded: Sydney, Pyrmont, Ultimo, Haymarket, The Rocks, Dawes Point, Millers Point, Barangaroo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately 13 suburbs were dropped in the creation of a new, revised dataframe of suburbs and their coordinates.\n",

The Foursquare venue data includes many business, restaurant and amenity types – expanding beyond licensed venues – and is therefore a good data source for k-means cluster analysis when the goal involves generating subgroups to explore possible suburb similarity. The results were stored in a dataframe for subsequent analysis and summary. \n",

Of these, 35 were the 'small bar' licence type. The frequency counts for the different licence types for the suburbs of interest were merged with the Foursquare venue counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cluster analysis with k-means\n",
    "\n",
    "With the merged data, presence of venue types (Foursquare categories) and licence types (Data.NSW categories) were dummified with one-hot encoding. The one-hot encoded dataframe was then used to generate standardised scores for venue type and licence type presence for each suburb. There were then 199 quantitative features for each suburb for the k-means analysis to explore suburb similarity.\n",

    "To assist with the model selection, a scree plot was created. Though it was not the most pronounced elbow point in the plot, this helped to guide the selection of '3' as the number of centers for the algorithm to operate with.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://eugeneward.com.au/study/images/coursera_capstone/capstone_screeplot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The cluster membership results of the k-means were one subgroup of 25 suburbs, one subgroup of 6 suburbs and one subgroup of 1 suburb. The top five venue types for each suburb retrieved from Foursquare helped to establish context when interpretting the characteristics of cluster categories. Broadly, the '0' label cluster included suburbs which tend towards having more venues focused on nightlife activity and the '2' label cluster included suburbs which tend towards featuring more venues focused on daytime activities. The '1' label cluster included the suburb of Eastlakes only. From inspection it seems it also tends towards daytime activity venues but within this the specific venue types appeared to be substantially different from the venues present in the '2' label cluster. However a limitation of the data is that Foursquare returned only 2 venues and the licence list features only 4 sites for Eastlakes, respectively. There was an overwhelmingly popular venue in the Foursquare data across many of the suburbs queried – cafes. Looking beyond the 1st most common venues where cafes dominate, the '0' label cluster suburbs tended to feature bars and pubs in the their top five venue types. The two suburbs with the most small bar licences, Newtown and Darlinghurst (8 each), were both '0' cluster members. Whereas the '2' cluster suburbs top five venue types featured parks, transport infrastructure, convenience/grocery stores and bakeries. The total small bar licences in the cluster '0' suburbs was 35 while the total small bar licences in the cluster '2' suburbs was 0.\n",

    "The cluster '0' (red markers) member suburbs - i.e. the 'night life' suburbs – radiate outward from the Sydney CBD (at the north of the focus area). The cluster '1' suburbs (green markers) are then at the edges of the '0' cluster suburbs. However there is an exception to this pattern, where Sydenham and St Peters ('1' cluster members) are surrounded by '0' cluster suburbs to their north, east and south.\n",

    "### Further exploration of the Data.NSW dataset\n",

    "**Map: Aggregate liquor licences for suburbs with number of small bars**\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, despite its top position for total licences, Surry Hills is not the top suburb for small bars. Instead this position is held by Newtown and Darlinghurst, each with 8 small bars. The highest proportional score for small bar presence relative to total licences is Enmore, where small bars make up 3 licences out of a total 28 active liquor licences. This visualisation also shows that small bars tend to be located to the west of the latitude of the Sydney CBD and Surry Hills. Past Potts Point, there are zero small bars in the suburbs of interest to the east (Rushcutters Bay, Elizabeth Bay, Edgecliff, Darling Point, Point Piper and Woollahra) or those directly south past Redfern (Waterloo, Zetland, Kensington, Rosebery and Eastlakes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Liveable Sydney Study data\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the Liveable Sydney Study 2019 was commissioned by Domain Group and involved analyses by consultants Tract and Deloitte. It scored all of Sydney's suburbs on 19 liveability indicators. A selection of some of these indicators were examined for the suburbs of interest in order to supplement this project's research regarding the decision on best candidate suburbs for future small bar locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The liveability indicator scores that of interest from this dataset were 'bus', 'train' 'walkability' and 'culture.' The total rank was also determined to be of interest – since it is the aspect prominently featured on Domain's content pages and may have an impact on future suburb popularity (not only for property purchasers but it may also be an index that tourists look at when deciding to choose somwhere to go for a drink).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scores across these indicators were summed to provide a basic guiding index for suburb characteristics that might increase their suitability as a small bar location.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://eugeneward.com.au/study/images/coursera_capstone/capstone_lss_scores_head.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make these scores more meaningful in the context of this project, this was merged to include the cluster labels. This created a dataframe that could then be queried for suburbs that met the criteria of: above average LSS indicator scores and no small bars currently operating (with cluster membership and total suburb rank in the LSS providing additional context).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://eugeneward.com.au/study/images/coursera_capstone/capstone_summary_table_decisionquery.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the final stage of analysis used to refine the recommendations. Though there were suburbs with good LSS indicator scores and in cases very high overall Greater Sydney suburb ranks (per Domain's study), '2' cluster membership – as calculated earlier in the k-means – was interpreted as indicating suburban contexts where there was a poor foundational environment for new hospitality businesses of any kind. These were suburbs without the context to support new small bars and where the local people may not have had an interest in them. For both types of opportunity suburbs identified, '0' cluster membership was seen as the essential first criteria."

    "# 4: Findings and Recommendations\n",
    "## 4.1: Evaluating the two types of opportunity suburbs\n",
    "### 'Untapped neighbours to night time economy centres'\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of opportunity suburb for small bars draws on a common driver for commercial location decisions: observing existing hotspots for a particular market and joining them in direct competition, or alternatively, as this project recommends, observing the hotspot locations and then pushing at the edges of these market centres. The idea being that you establish the business ahead of the next hotspot for first mover advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, it was observed that many of the suburbs of interest support nightlife and are well-resourced when it comes to the broader bars and hotels industry. From review of the k-means cluster analysis results, this was what seemed to be a primary characteristic that emerged in the large '0' cluster of suburbs. However, as observed in the map visualisation 'Aggregate liquor licences for suburbs with number of small bars,' there wasn't a direct correlation with high numbers of liquor licences of all kinds and the presence of currently operating small bars. Newtown, Darlinghurst and Enmore demonstrate that there are 'CBD precipice' suburb characteristics presently attracting small bar operators, which may potentially include a civic structure where commercial centres co-mingle with but do not overwhelm residential areas. A small bar should be a short walk for locals, like the night-time equivalent of a cafe – it is not necessarily something they will venture to the CBD for.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 'New directions'\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of opportunity suburb is also guided by the aim to forecast future hotpots in this market. However, rather than beginning with the criteria of proximity to an active centre, this category of recommended suburbs goes further afield and is instead based on exceptional scoring in suitability evaluation. These are suburbs not necessarily abutting the night time economy centres, but which score above average in the relevant liveability indicators, ranked highly overall in the LSS and, importantly, are also members of the '0' cluster, indicating similarity to active night time economy suburbs and thefore potentially an environment and context that would suit small bars.\n",
